          <h2>Le ski</h2>
          <p>I live near Annecy and its many mountains since I was born. That’s why I ski since my three years and why I really enjoy that sport. I have begun the ski with my parents and after I have learned with a ski instructor.
            Then, I have joined a ski competition club where I practiced two disciplines, the Slalom and the Giant. I improved myself a lot during that time. Finally, I turned into freeride skiing where I can do more 
            as I want and express myself with the ski. Due to that disciplines, I am able to ski in different types of slopes and snows. One of the best advantages about freeride is that gives me access to inaccessible places
            and landscapes.</p>

          <p>I watch basketballs games of the NBA league for a few years, especially those of my favorite team : Golden State Warriors. I was so proud of them when I watched them winning the last season league. I’ve 
          always wanted to play basketball but I didn’t have the time for during my high school years. That bothered me particularly because really enjoyed that beautiful sport. Finally, by joining the “IUT” I noticed that the 
          school offered a basketball section for beginners and others, and I decided to register. Then after several trainings I realized that I love to watch and practice basketball. I am always practicing basketball with the 
          IUT and I am decided to continue as long as I will be able to.</p>

          <h2>La guitare</h2>
          <p>Finally, I particularly like listening music and that’s why I wanted to learn a musical instrument. I went towards the guitar, and I learned it alone with guitar tabs and youtube video. I decided later to take some 
          lesson and during one year I have learned the same instrument but in another “squarer” way, starting by learning to read notes and only after to play them.  Then I realized that learning method was not that really 
          interested me about playing the guitar. I preferred to learn on my own music pieces that I wanted. Today, I continue to play the guitar for me and as I want.  Playing that instrument allow me to calm down and 
          forget the rest.</p>
